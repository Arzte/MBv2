# MegaBot v2
This is a rewrite of the, now deprecated, [DiscordFeedback](https://github.com/Dougley/DiscordFeedback) system.

## Installation
Please note that this is a highly specialized project, we won't guarantee compatibility with your environment/setup.    
That being said, at least Node.js v8 or higher is required due to the use of modern JavaScript. An example `.env` configuration file can be found in the project root, edit it accordingly and **save it as `.env`, not `.env.example`**

## Testing
```
npm test
```
